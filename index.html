Well, we sure as hell canâ€™t spend over $2000 on flights, hotel, and food. So, whatâ€™s the next best thing we could do? Well, I thought we could take the destination home, right into our living room.<br/><br/>Any ideas?</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">That's right. You're getting a fucking aquarium. And not just any aquarium, but a goddamn saltwater aquarium with fishies like you see here. There are tons of awesome and colorful fish, like Clownfish (Nemo) and Royal Blue Tang (Dory), plus tons of other fishes that I don't know the names of. Are you excited yet???</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">Well the fun doesn't stop there. As you're probably aware of, saltwater aquariums don't only hold fish. Itâ€™s common for saltwater aquariums to house sea anemones and coral too, both of which are living and help keep the ecosystem in balance. These also range in a variety of colors and types and will make the aquarium a ton more beautiful. Honestly, even Iâ€™m excited about this and we both know Derek is going to love it.</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">I was surprised to see how much you already knew about this stuff, primarly around how expensive it's going to be and how much maintenance is required. If you feel you're up for it, let's start talking about a budget and learn what we can afford with that. From there, we can at the very least get a tank and start letting the water cycle while we decide what sea life you're going to want.<br/><br/>Are you ready? ðŸ˜Š</p>
