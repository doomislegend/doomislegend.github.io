Well, we sure as hell can’t spend over $2000 on flights, hotel, and food. So, what’s the next best thing we could do? Well, I thought we could take the destination home, right into our living room.<br/><br/>Any ideas?</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">That’s right. You’re getting a fucking aquarium. And not just any aquarium. A fucking saltwater aquarium with little guys like this one you see to the right. There’s tons of awesome and colorful fish, like Clownfish (Nemo) and Royal Blue Tang (Dory), plus other fishes that I don’t know the names of.<br/><br/>There are no squids, though. I'm sorry.</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">The cool thing is that it’s not just fish. It’s common for saltwater aquariums to house sea anemones and coral too, both of which are living and help keep the ecosystem in balance. These also range in a variety of colors and types and will make the aquarium a ton more beautiful. Honestly, even I’m excited about this and I'm sure Derek is going to love it.</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">Research. I’ve been doing a bit myself and I still only have a very basic understanding of what’s needed to get things started. It takes time to get things going — we can’t just go to the store and walk out with everything we need plus all the fish. They’re pretty high maintenance until you get into the swing of things, but also very rewarding from what I’ve read. Basically, let’s start talking about it.</p>
